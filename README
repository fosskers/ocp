ocp - Obsessive Compulsive Python
---------------------------------

Does code not lined up all pretty-like bother you?
Does your Haskell experience make you want to line up all your
assignment operators? Is so, then ocp is for you.
ocp will line up all your code when possible with the goal
of making your code as visually pleasing as it deserves to be.

INSTALLING OCP
--------------
Add the following to your .bashrc file:
  alias ocp='python3 /path/to/ocp/ocp.py'

RUNNING OCP
-----------
After installing ocp and restarting your terminal, running:
  ocp some-source.py

will beautify your code, and save it in a copy file labeled like:
  ocp-some-source.py 

Make sure to review the prettified code before you accept it as your
master copy!

EXTENDING OCP
-------------
The global variable 'keyword' stores the keys by which code is lined up.
By changing the values in keywords, you can change what keys will
determine how your code is aligned. 
Later, this will become a standard feature so delving into the source
code will not be necessary. By doing this, ocp will be usable for much
more than just aligning code.
